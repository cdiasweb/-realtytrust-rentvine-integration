Please view the video or pictures that are available and register at www.OhioRental.info to be notified when they are available. Pets: This home is pet-friendly. The cost of the pet will be decided per Fido score. Dogs on the insurance ban list are not allowed. Utilities: Tenant pays for water, sewer, trash, gas, electricity, internet, and phone. Appliances: See appliances at the property -those will stay. Parking: Detached garage. Tenant insurance: Landlord insurance never covers tenant property, so proof of tenant insurance is required before move-in. We have found it very much appreciated by tenants, and it gives peace of mind. It can usually be purchased for a minimal amount of money. Application and screening: All applicants 18 and older must fill out an application and pay the $45 application fee. This property will continue to be offered until Realty Trust Services is in possession of certified funds to hold the property from being rented to an APPROVED applicant. We screen on multiple dimensions with an eye on seeing how applicants could, in fact, be great tenants. If you want this home, please apply! The landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made, then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing. All information in this ad is deemed accurate, but the tenant is responsible for inspecting the property to make sure it is acceptable. Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information with our listings. It is especially important that you verify important information like the existence of appliances or the existence of a working AC unit.\nHOMES ARE RENTED AS-IS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO SAFETY/HEALTH HAZARDS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE TENANT(S) OR THEIR LEASE.",

Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information in with our listings. It is especially important that you verify important information like existence of appliances or existence of a working AC unit. HOMES ARE RENTED AS-IS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO SAFETY/HEALTH HAZARDS THAT COULD JEAPORDIZE THE TENANT(S) OR THEIR LEASE.",

Pets: This home is pet-friendly. The cost of a pet depends on the pet's FIDO score. Dogs on the insurance ban list are not allowed. Utilities: Tenant pays all utilities. Appliances: See appliances at the property - those will stay. Tenant insurance: Landlord insurance never covers tenant property so proof of tenant insurance is required before moving in. We have found it very much appreciated by tenants and it gives us peace of mind. It can usually be purchased for a minimal amount of money. Application and screening: All applicants 18 and older must fill out an application and pay the $45 application fee. This property will continue to be offered until Realty Trust Services is in possession of certified funds to hold the property from being rented to an APPROVED applicant. We screen on multiple dimensions with an eye on seeing how applicants could in fact be great tenants. If you want this home please apply! The landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing. All information in this ad is deemed accurate but the tenant is responsible for inspecting the property to make sure it is acceptable. Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information with our listings. You must verify important information like the existence of appliances or the existence of a working AC unit. HOMES ARE RENTED AS-IS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO SAFETY/HEALTH HAZARDS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE TENANT(S) OR THEIR LEASE.",

Parking: Parking available in driveway, on  the street and in one space of the 2-car garage. Section 8: Section 8 vouchers will  be accepted at this property. Tenant insurance: Landlord insurance never covers tenant property so proof of tenant insurance is required before move-in. We have found it very much appreciated by tenants and it gives you peace of mind. It can usually be purchased for a minimal amount of money. Application and screening: All applicants 18 and older must fill out an application and pay the $45 application fee. This property will continue to be offered until Realty Trust Services is in possession of certified funds to the hold property from being rented to an APPROVED applicant. We screen on multiple dimensions with an eye on seeing how applicants could in fact be great tenants. If you want this home please apply! Landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing. All information in this ad is deemed accurate but the tenant is responsible to inspect property to make sure it is acceptable. Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information in with our listings. It is especially important that you verify important information like the existence of appliances or the existence of a working AC unit. Pets Allowed",

Please view the video or pictures that are available and register at http://OhioRental.info to be notified when they are available. Pets: This home is pet-friendly. The cost of the pet will be decided per fido score. Dogs on the insurance ban list are not allowed. Utilities: Tenant pays water, sewer, trash, gas, electric, internet, and phone. Appliances: See appliances at property -those will stay. Parking: Parking available on street. Tenant insurance: Landlord insurance never covers tenant property, so proof of tenant insurance is required before move-in. We have found it very much appreciated by tenants, and it gives peace of mind. It can usually be purchased for a minimal amount of money. Application and screening: All applicants 18 and older must fill out an application and pay the $45 application fee. This property will continue to be offered until Realty Trust Services is in possession of certified funds to hold the property from being rented to an APPROVED applicant. We screen on multiple dimensions with an eye on seeing how applicants could, in fact, be great tenants. If you want this home, please apply! The landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made, then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing. All information in this ad is deemed accurate, but the tenant is responsible for inspecting the property to make sure it is acceptable. Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information with our listings. It is especially important that you verify important information like the existence of appliances or the existence of a working AC unit. HOMES ARE RENTED AS-IS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO SAFETY/HEALTH HAZARDS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE TENANT(S) OR THEIR LEASE.",

    "Marketing Description": "Discover the spacious and bright upper unit at 3558 W 69th St, located in Cleveland’s lively Stockyards neighborhood. This 1910-built duplex, currently configured as up-down, offers renters a comfortable and functional layout with 3 bedrooms and 1 bathroom. The unit includes essential kitchen appliances: a refrigerator and stove, so you can move in and start cooking right away.\n\nStockyards is a classic Cleveland neighborhood with a strong sense of community and a blend of local shops, eateries, and green spaces. Its proximity to popular areas like Gordon Square, West Side Market, Tremont, and Ohio City gives you access to cultural and culinary destinations within easy reach.\nThe location benefits tenants seeking a balance between city energy and neighborhood warmth, rooted in local character, yet near bigger urban hubs.\n\nUnit Features:\n\t•\t3 bedrooms\n\t•\t1 bathroom\n\t•\tRefrigerator\n\t•\tStove\n\nBeware of scammers! Never make a payment without completing our application process, or send payments through PayPal.\n\nSchedule a viewing today. Your dream space awaits! Availability: Visit www.OhioRental.info to schedule online or call 440-484-5800 for a convenient and quick showing. Please view the video or pictures that are available and register at www.OhioRental.info to be notified when they are available. Pets: This home is pet-friendly. The cost of the pet will be decided per Fido score. Dogs on the insurance ban list are not allowed. Utilities: Tenant pays for water, sewer, trash, gas, electricity, internet, and phone. Appliances: See appliances at the property -those will stay. Parking: Off-Street parking. Tenant insurance: Landlord insurance never covers tenant property, so proof of tenant insurance is required before move-in. We have found it very much appreciated by tenants, and it gives peace of mind. It can usually be purchased for a minimal amount of money. Application and screening: All applicants 18 and older must fill out an application and pay the $45 application fee. This property will continue to be offered until Realty Trust Services is in possession of certified funds to hold the property from being rented to an APPROVED applicant. We screen on multiple dimensions with an eye on seeing how applicants could, in fact, be great tenants. If you want this home, please apply! The landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made, then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing. All information in this ad is deemed accurate, but the tenant is responsible for inspecting the property to make sure it is acceptable. Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information with our listings. It is especially important that you verify important information like the existence of appliances or the existence of a working AC unit.\nHOMES ARE RENTED AS-IS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO SAFETY/HEALTH HAZARDS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE TENANT(S) OR THEIR LEASE.",

    "Marketing Title": "Well-Equipped 3-Bedroom Home with Detached Garage in Cleveland",
    "Posting Title": "",
    "Marketing Description": "Located at 1514 Clermont Road, Cleveland, OH 44110, this single-family home features 3 bedrooms and 1 bathroom, offering a solid layout for daily living. Each room provides its own defined space, and the full bath is positioned for practical use throughout the home. The kitchen comes equipped with a refrigerator and stove, so you're set with the essentials from day one. Outside, a detached garage offers added convenience—whether you use it for parking or storage, it's a valuable bonus to the property. Situated in a Cleveland neighborhood with residential character, this home balances simplicity with the functionality renters need. Schedule your tour and see if this well-equipped space fits your needs.\n\nBeware of scammers! Never make a payment without completing our application process, or send payments through PayPal.\n\nSchedule a viewing today. Your dream space awaits! Availability: Visit www.OhioRental.info to schedule online or call 440-484-5800 for a convenient and quick showing. Please view the video or pictures that are available and register at www.OhioRental.info to be notified when they are available. Pets: This home is pet-friendly. The cost of the pet will be decided per Fido score. Dogs on the insurance ban list are not allowed. Utilities: Tenant pays for water, sewer, trash, gas, electricity, internet, and phone. Appliances: See appliances at the property -those will stay. Parking: Detached garage. Tenant insurance: Landlord insurance never covers tenant property, so proof of tenant insurance is required before move-in. We have found it very much appreciated by tenants, and it gives peace of mind. It can usually be purchased for a minimal amount of money. Application and screening: All applicants 18 and older must fill out an application and pay the $45 application fee. This property will continue to be offered until Realty Trust Services is in possession of certified funds to hold the property from being rented to an APPROVED applicant. We screen on multiple dimensions with an eye on seeing how applicants could, in fact, be great tenants. If you want this home, please apply! The landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made, then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing. All information in this ad is deemed accurate, but the tenant is responsible for inspecting the property to make sure it is acceptable. Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information with our listings. It is especially important that you verify important information like the existence of appliances or the existence of a working AC unit. \nHOMES ARE RENTED AS-IS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO SAFETY/HEALTH HAZARDS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE TENANT(S) OR THEIR LEASE.",

Landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing. All information in this ad is deemed accurate but tenant is responsible to inspect property to make sure it is acceptable. Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information in with our listings. It is especially important that you verify important information like existence of appliances or existence of a working AC unit. HOMES ARE RENTED AS-IS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO SAFETY/HEALTH HAZARDS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE TENANT(S) OR THEIR LEASE.",

Please view the video or pictures that are available and register at www.OhioRental.info to be notified when they are available. Pets: This home is pet-friendly. The cost of the pet will be decided per Fido score. Dogs on the insurance ban list are not allowed. Utilities: Tenant pays for water, sewer, trash, gas, electricity, internet, and phone. Appliances: See appliances at the property -those will stay. Parking: on-street parking. Tenant insurance: Landlord insurance never covers tenant property, so proof of tenant insurance is required before move-in. We have found it very much appreciated by tenants, and it gives peace of mind. It can usually be purchased for a minimal amount of money. Application and screening: All applicants 18 and older must fill out an application and pay the $45 application fee. This property will continue to be offered until Realty Trust Services is in possession of certified funds to hold the property from being rented to an APPROVED applicant. We screen on multiple dimensions with an eye on seeing how applicants could, in fact, be great tenants. If you want this home, please apply! The landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made, then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing. All information in this ad is deemed accurate, but the tenant is responsible for inspecting the property to make sure it is acceptable. Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information with our listings. It is especially important that you verify important information like the existence of appliances or the existence of a working AC unit. HOMES ARE RENTED AS-IS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO SAFETY/HEALTH HAZARDS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE TENANT(S) OR THEIR LEASE.",

    "Posting Title": "Spacious 3BR 1.5B Home with Garage & Fenced Yard in Parma",
    "Marketing Description": "This well-maintained 3-bedroom, 1.5-bath single-family home offers a practical two-level layout. The main level includes an entry foyer opening to a family/media room, a convenient half bath, and a laundry area with an in-unit washer and dryer. Upstairs, a living room flows into a dining area and a kitchen equipped with a refrigerator, microwave, and dishwasher. Three bedrooms and a full bathroom occupy the upper level, creating a straightforward plan where all bedrooms share the full bath. The home includes central A/C and ceiling fans for year-round comfort.\n\nHighlights\n\t•\tIn-Unit Laundry: Washer and dryer are included for convenient laundry.\n\t•\tKitchen Amenities: Refrigerator, microwave, and dishwasher are provided for easy meal prep.\n\t•\tClimate Control: Central A/C and ceiling fans in the living spaces ensure efficient comfort.\n\t•\tOutdoor Space: Fenced backyard offers a private area for outdoor activities and pets.\n\t•\tParking: Attached one-car garage provides secure parking and storage.\n\nLocation & Neighborhood\n\nLocated in Parma, this home is close to many community amenities. The Parma City School District serves the area: Pleasant Valley Elementary, Greenbriar Middle, and Valley Forge High (8-12) are all within about 1–2 miles. Outdoor recreation is convenient: Anthony Zielinski Park and Veterans Memorial Park (sports fields, tennis courts, and walking paths) are both nearby. Green spaces and recreation are also abundant: the Cleveland Metroparks West Creek Reservation (100 acres of trails and wetlands) and a city-owned golf course are in Parma. In short, this house pairs its modern conveniences (AC, appliances, in-home laundry, garage and fenced yard) with the benefits of Parma’s schools, parks, and shopping, making it an attractive rental home.\n\nBeware of scammers! Never make a payment without completing our application process, and never send payments through PayPal.\n\n Schedule a viewing today. Your dream space awaits! Availability: Visit www.OhioRental.info to schedule online or call 440-484-5800 for a convenient and quick showing. Please view the video or pictures that are available and register at www.OhioRental.info to be notified when they are available. Pets: This home is pet-friendly. The cost of the pet will be decided per Fido score. Dogs on the insurance ban list are not allowed. Utilities: Tenant pays for water, sewer, trash, gas, electricity, internet, and phone. Appliances: See appliances at the property -those will stay. Parking: Garage. Tenant insurance: Landlord insurance never covers tenant property, so proof of tenant insurance is required before move-in. We have found it very much appreciated by tenants, and it gives peace of mind. It can usually be purchased for a minimal amount of money. Application and screening: All applicants 18 and older must fill out an application and pay the $45 application fee. This property will continue to be offered until Realty Trust Services is in possession of certified funds to hold the property from being rented to an APPROVED applicant. We screen on multiple dimensions with an eye on seeing how applicants could, in fact, be great tenants. If you want this home, please apply! The landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made, then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing. All information in this ad is deemed accurate, but the tenant is responsible for inspecting the property to make sure it is acceptable. Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information with our listings. It is especially important that you verify important information like the existence of appliances or the existence of a working AC unit.\n\nHOMES ARE RENTED AS-IS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO SAFETY/HEALTH HAZARDS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE TENANT(S) OR THEIR LEASE.",

Landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing.

It is especially important that you verify important information like existence of appliances or existence of a working AC unit. HOMES ARE RENTED AS-IS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO SAFETY/HEALTH HAZARDS THAT COULD JEAPORDIZE THE TENANT(S) OR THEIR LEASE.",

We have found it very much appreciated by tenants and it gives you peace of mind. It can usually be purchased for a minimal amount of money. Application and screening: All applicants 18 and older must fill out an application and pay the $45 application fee. This property will continue to be offered until Realty Trust Services is in possession of certified funds from the  APPROVED applicant. We screen on multiple dimensions with an eye on seeing how applicants could in fact be great tenants. If you want this home please apply! Landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing. All information in this ad is deemed accurate but the tenant is responsible to inspect property to make sure it is acceptable. Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information in with our listings. It is especially important that you verify important information like the existence of appliances or the existence of a working AC unit. Pets: This home is pet friendly. Cost of pet depends on pet FIDO score. Dogs on the insurance ban list not allowed. Utilities: Tenant pays all utilities.",

Availability: Visit www.OhioRental.info to schedule online or call 440-484-5800 for a convenient and quick showing. Please view the video or pictures that are available and register at www.OhioRental.info to be notified when they are available. Pets: This home is pet-friendly. The cost of the pet will be decided per Fido score. Dogs on the insurance ban list are not allowed. Utilities: Tenant pays for water, sewer, trash, gas, electricity, internet, and phone. Appliances: See appliances at the property -those will stay. Parking: Detached garage. Tenant insurance: Landlord insurance never covers tenant property, so proof of tenant insurance is required before move-in. We have found it very much appreciated by tenants, and it gives peace of mind. It can usually be purchased for a minimal amount of money. Application and screening: All applicants 18 and older must fill out an application and pay the $45 application fee. This property will continue to be offered until Realty Trust Services is in possession of certified funds to hold the property from being rented to an APPROVED applicant. We screen on multiple dimensions with an eye on seeing how applicants could, in fact, be great tenants. If you want this home, please apply! The landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made, then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing. All information in this ad is deemed accurate, but the tenant is responsible for inspecting the property to make sure it is acceptable. Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information with our listings. It is especially important that you verify important information like the existence of appliances or the existence of a working AC unit. \nHOMES ARE RENTED AS-IS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO SAFETY/HEALTH HAZARDS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE TENANT(S) OR THEIR LEASE.",

Please view the video or pictures that are available and register at www.OhioRental.info to be notified when they are available. Pets: This home is pet-friendly. The cost of the pet will be decided per Fido score. Dogs on the insurance ban list are not allowed. Utilities: Tenant pays for water, sewer, trash, gas, electricity, internet, and phone. Appliances: See appliances at the property -those will stay. Parking: Detached garage. Tenant insurance: Landlord insurance never covers tenant property, so proof of tenant insurance is required before move-in. We have found it very much appreciated by tenants, and it gives peace of mind. It can usually be purchased for a minimal amount of money. Application and screening: All applicants 18 and older must fill out an application and pay the $45 application fee. This property will continue to be offered until Realty Trust Services is in possession of certified funds to hold the property from being rented to an APPROVED applicant. We screen on multiple dimensions with an eye on seeing how applicants could, in fact, be great tenants. If you want this home, please apply! The landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made, then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing. All information in this ad is deemed accurate, but the tenant is responsible for inspecting the property to make sure it is acceptable. Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information with our listings. It is especially important that you verify important information like the existence of appliances or the existence of a working AC unit. \nHOMES ARE RENTED AS-IS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO SAFETY/HEALTH HAZARDS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE TENANT(S) OR THEIR LEASE.",

Availability: Visit www.OhioRental.info to schedule online or call 440-484-5800 for a convenient and quick showing. Please view the video or pictures that are available and register at www.OhioRental.info to be notified when they are available. Pets: This home is pet-friendly. The cost of the pet will be decided per Fido score. Dogs on the insurance ban list are not allowed. Utilities: Tenant pays for water, sewer, trash, gas, electricity, internet, and phone. Appliances: See appliances at the property -those will stay. Parking: Off-street parking. Tenant insurance: Landlord insurance never covers tenant property, so proof of tenant insurance is required before move-in. We have found it very much appreciated by tenants, and it gives peace of mind. It can usually be purchased for a minimal amount of money. Application and screening: All applicants 18 and older must fill out an application and pay the $45 application fee. This property will continue to be offered until Realty Trust Services is in possession of certified funds to hold the property from being rented to an APPROVED applicant. We screen on multiple dimensions with an eye on seeing how applicants could, in fact, be great tenants. If you want this home, please apply! The landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made, then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing. All information in this ad is deemed accurate, but the tenant is responsible for inspecting the property to make sure it is acceptable. Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information with our listings. It is especially important that you verify important information like the existence of appliances or the existence of a working AC unit. \nHOMES ARE RENTED AS-IS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO SAFETY/HEALTH HAZARDS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE TENANT(S) OR THEIR LEASE.",

Appliances: See appliances at property -those will stay. Parking: Parking available in driveway, one car detached garage. Section 8: This home is not accepting section 8 at this property. Please feel free to check out what other properties we have in our portal. Tenant insurance: Landlord insurance never covers tenant property, so proof of tenant insurance is required before move-in. We have found it very much appreciated by tenants, and it gives peace of mind. It can usually be purchased for a minimal amount of money. Application and screening: All applicants 18 and older must fill out an application and pay the $45 application fee. This property will continue to be offered until Realty Trust Services is in possession of certified funds to hold the property from being rented to an APPROVED applicant. We screen on multiple dimensions with an eye on seeing how applicants could, in fact, be great tenants. If you want this home, please apply! The landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made, then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing. All information in this ad is deemed accurate, but the tenant is responsible for inspecting the property to make sure it is acceptable. Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information with our listings. It is especially important that you verify important information like the existence of appliances or the existence of a working AC unit. HOMES ARE RENTED AS-IS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO SAFETY/HEALTH HAZARDS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE TENANT(S) OR THEIR LEASE.",

Availability: Visit www.OhioRental.info to schedule online or call 440-484-5800 for a convenient and quick showing. Please view the video or pictures that are available and register at www.OhioRental.info to be notified when they are available. Pets: This home is pet-friendly. The cost of the pet will be decided per Fido score. Dogs on the insurance ban list are not allowed. Utilities: Tenant pays for water, sewer, trash, gas, electricity, internet, and phone. Appliances: See appliances at the property -those will stay. Parking: Detached garage. Tenant insurance: Landlord insurance never covers tenant property, so proof of tenant insurance is required before move-in. We have found it very much appreciated by tenants, and it gives peace of mind. It can usually be purchased for a minimal amount of money. Application and screening: All applicants 18 and older must fill out an application and pay the $45 application fee. This property will continue to be offered until Realty Trust Services is in possession of certified funds to hold the property from being rented to an APPROVED applicant. We screen on multiple dimensions with an eye on seeing how applicants could, in fact, be great tenants. If you want this home, please apply! The landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made, then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing. All information in this ad is deemed accurate, but the tenant is responsible for inspecting the property to make sure it is acceptable. Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information with our listings. It is especially important that you verify important information like the existence of appliances or the existence of a working AC unit. \nHOMES ARE RENTED AS-IS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO SAFETY/HEALTH HAZARDS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE TENANT(S) OR THEIR LEASE.",

Availability: Visit www.OhioRental.info to schedule online or call 440-484-5800 for a convenient and quick showing. Please view the video or pictures that are available and register at www.OhioRental.info to be notified when they are available. Pets: This home is pet-friendly. The cost of the pet will be decided per Fido score. Dogs on the insurance ban list are not allowed. Utilities: Tenant pays for water, sewer, trash, gas, electricity, internet, and phone. Appliances: See appliances at the property -those will stay. Parking: Driveway parking. Tenant insurance: Landlord insurance never covers tenant property, so proof of tenant insurance is required before move-in. We have found it very much appreciated by tenants, and it gives peace of mind. It can usually be purchased for a minimal amount of money. Application and screening: All applicants 18 and older must fill out an application and pay the $45 application fee. This property will continue to be offered until Realty Trust Services is in possession of certified funds to hold the property from being rented to an APPROVED applicant. We screen on multiple dimensions with an eye on seeing how applicants could, in fact, be great tenants. If you want this home, please apply! The landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made, then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing. All information in this ad is deemed accurate, but the tenant is responsible for inspecting the property to make sure it is acceptable. Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information with our listings. It is especially important that you verify important information like the existence of appliances or the existence of a working AC unit. \nHOMES ARE RENTED AS-IS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO SAFETY/HEALTH HAZARDS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE TENANT(S) OR THEIR LEASE.",

Please feel free to check out what other property we have in our portal Tenant insurance: Landlord insurance never covers tenant property so proof of tenant insurance is required before move in.

Application and screening: All applicants 18 and older must fill out an application and pay the $45 application fee. This property will continue to be offered until Realty Trust Services is in possession of certified funds to the hold property from being rented to an APPROVED applicant. We screen on multiple dimensions with an eye on seeing how applicants could in fact be great tenants. If you want this home please apply! Landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing. All information in this ad is deemed accurate but tenant is responsible to inspect property to make sure it is acceptable. Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information in with our listings. It is especially important that you verify important information like existence of appliances or existence of a working AC unit.",

The cost of the pet will be decided per fido score. Dogs on the insurance ban list are not allowed. Utilities: Tenant pays water, sewer, trash, gas, electric, internet, and phone. Appliances: See appliances at property -those will stay. Parking: Parking available in driveway, one car detached garage. Tenant insurance: Landlord insurance never covers tenant property, so proof of tenant insurance is required before move-in. We have found it very much appreciated by tenants, and it gives peace of mind. It can usually be purchased for a minimal amount of money. Application and screening: All applicants 18 and older must fill out an application and pay the $45 application fee. This property will continue to be offered until Realty Trust Services is in possession of certified funds to hold the property from being rented to an APPROVED applicant. We screen on multiple dimensions with an eye on seeing how applicants could, in fact, be great tenants. If you want this home, please apply! The landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made, then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing. All information in this ad is deemed accurate, but the tenant is responsible for inspecting the property to make sure it is acceptable. Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information with our listings. It is especially important that you verify important information like the existence of appliances or the existence of a working AC unit. HOMES ARE RENTED AS-IS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO SAFETY/HEALTH HAZARDS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE TENANT(S) OR THEIR LEASE.",

    "Marketing Description": "Welcome Section 8/EDEN\n\nSTEP INTO A 3D TOUR:\nhttps://www.zillow.com/view-imx/fdbc018f-a8d0-491a-abd4-a3c4383a6a40?setAttribution=mls&wl=true&initialViewType=pano&utm_source=dashboard\n\nLocated at 6115 Merkle Ave Unit Down, Parma, OH 44129, this 2-bedroom, 1-bath home offers a practical living option in a well-established residential area. The layout includes a functional living space, two bedrooms suited for rest or daily use, and a full bathroom positioned for everyday convenience.\n\nThe property includes driveway parking, providing a designated space for your vehicle and eliminating the need for street parking. Situated in Parma, this location places you within reach of the city's local amenities, services, and main roads while maintaining a residential feel.\n\nIf you're seeking a simple, well-located place to call home, this unit delivers the essentials without the extras. Contact us today to schedule your tour.\n\nBeware of scammers! Never make a payment without completing our application process, and never send payments through PayPal.\n\nSchedule a viewing today. Your dream space awaits! Availability: Visit www.OhioRental.info to schedule online or call 440-484-5800 for a convenient and quick showing. Please view the video or pictures that are available and register at www.OhioRental.info to be notified when they are available. Pets: No pets. The cost of the pet will be decided per Fido score. Dogs on the insurance ban list are not allowed. Utilities: Tenant pays for water, sewer, trash, gas, electricity, internet, and phone. Appliances: See appliances at the property -those will stay. Parking: Off-street. Tenant insurance: Landlord insurance never covers tenant property, so proof of tenant insurance is required before move-in. We have found it very much appreciated by tenants, and it gives peace of mind. It can usually be purchased for a minimal amount of money. Application and screening: All applicants 18 and older must fill out an application and pay the $45 application fee. This property will continue to be offered until Realty Trust Services is in possession of certified funds to hold the property from being rented to an APPROVED applicant. We screen on multiple dimensions with an eye on seeing how applicants could, in fact, be great tenants. If you want this home, please apply! The landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made, then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing. All information in this ad is deemed accurate, but the tenant is responsible for inspecting the property to make sure it is acceptable. Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information with our listings. It is especially important that you verify important information like the existence of appliances or the existence of a working AC unit.  HOMES ARE RENTED AS-IS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO SAFETY/HEALTH HAZARDS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE TENANT(S) OR THEIR LEASE.",

    "Marketing Description": "Discover your next home in this 3-bedroom, 1.5-bathroom single-family house at 465 Huntmere Drive, Bay Village, OH. Enjoy a spacious layout with a fridge, stove, and dishwasher included for hassle-free living. Store your vehicles or gear in the generous 2-car detached garage. Situated in vibrant Bay Village, you’re just moments from Huntington Beach for scenic lakefront relaxation and top-rated schools for academic excellence. With quick access to Cleveland’s bustling downtown, this home puts you in the heart of it all. \n\nBeware of scammers! Never make a payment without completing our application process, or send payments through PayPal.\n\nSchedule a viewing today. Your dream space awaits! Availability: Visit www.OhioRental.info to schedule online or call 440-484-5800 for a convenient and quick showing. Please view the video or pictures that are available and register at www.OhioRental.info to be notified when they are available. Pets: This home is pet-friendly. The cost of the pet will be decided per Fido score. Dogs on the insurance ban list are not allowed. Utilities: Tenant pays for water, sewer, trash, gas, electricity, internet, and phone. Appliances: See appliances at the property -those will stay. Parking: Detached garage. Tenant insurance: Landlord insurance never covers tenant property, so proof of tenant insurance is required before move-in. We have found it very much appreciated by tenants, and it gives peace of mind. It can usually be purchased for a minimal amount of money. Application and screening: All applicants 18 and older must fill out an application and pay the $45 application fee. This property will continue to be offered until Realty Trust Services is in possession of certified funds to hold the property from being rented to an APPROVED applicant. We screen on multiple dimensions with an eye on seeing how applicants could, in fact, be great tenants. If you want this home, please apply! The landlord may make screening exceptions in exchange for alternative terms. Property condition: Most properties are rented as is. If you wouldn't rent this property without specific changes made, then do not reserve the property unless those changes are agreed upon in writing. All information in this ad is deemed accurate, but the tenant is responsible for inspecting the property to make sure it is acceptable. Many websites that advertise our listings occasionally merge inaccurate information with our listings. It is especially important that you verify important information like the existence of appliances or the existence of a working AC unit.\nHOMES ARE RENTED AS-IS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO SAFETY/HEALTH HAZARDS THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE TENANT(S) OR THEIR LEASE.",
